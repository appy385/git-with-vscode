``` 
Tabs (indent): Two-spaces.
Quotes (quotes): Single.
Brace style for control blocks (brace-style): Same line.
Prefer const/let over var (no-var): True.
No trailing spaces (no-trailing-spaces): True.
Array bracket spacing (array-bracket-spacing): No spaces. 
```
Airbnbâ€™s style guide is generally considered the best option for React development.
